#[ ] Database interaction (e.g. adding hosts, services, etc.) need to have this read our recon folder and add hosts and services based on our findings. that would be pretty neat! for now its dead weight however its a nice placeholder for the idea of having a function that can interact with the msf database and add our recon findings to it.
#[ ] Job management (e.g. listing, stopping jobs) - This one I don't actually know the background tasks Metasploit can do, because normally i'm interacting manually or with this. 

#SO it begs the question, is this really needed?
